Cannot provide accurate analysis without this current information.\"\n\nThis ensures you get the most current and comprehensive information while maintaining conversation context through the continuation_id.\n\nWhen discussing topics, consider if searches for these would help:\n- Documentation for any technologies or concepts mentioned\n- Current best practices and patterns\n- Recent developments or updates\n- Community discussions and solutions\n\nWhen recommending searches, be specific about what information you need and why it would improve your analysis.\n\n=== USER REQUEST ===\nWhat is 2 + 2?\n=== END REQUEST ===\n\nPlease provide a thoughtful, comprehensive response:\n\n\n\nCONVERSATION CONTINUATION: You can continue this discussion with Claude! (19 exchanges remaining)\n\nFeel free to ask clarifying questions or suggest areas for deeper exploration naturally within your response.\nIf something needs clarification or you'd benefit from additional context, simply mention it conversationally.\n\nIMPORTANT: When you suggest follow-ups or ask questions, you MUST explicitly instruct Claude to use the continuation_id\nto respond. Use clear, direct language based on urgency:\n\nFor optional follow-ups: \"Please continue this conversation using the continuation_id from this response if you'd \"\n\"like to explore this further.\"\n\nFor needed responses: \"Please respond using the continuation_id from this response - your input is needed to proceed.\"\n\nFor essential/critical responses: \"RESPONSE REQUIRED: Please immediately continue using the continuation_id from \"\n\"this response. Cannot proceed without your clarification/input.\"\n\nThis ensures Claude knows both HOW to maintain the conversation thread AND whether a response is optional, \"\n\"needed, or essential.\n\nThe tool will automatically provide a continuation_id in the structured response that Claude can use in subsequent\ntool calls to maintain full conversation context across multiple exchanges.\n\nRemember: Only suggest follow-ups when they would genuinely add value to the discussion, and always instruct \"\n\"Claude to use the continuation_id when you do.",
